    <h3>Healthy Gut Routine</h3>

	<p> We tend to take our health for granted until something goes wrong. In my case, I was diagnosed with Acute Severe
	Ulcerative Colitis in February 2023. Ulcerative Colitis is a miserable digestive disease. I was hospitalized twice, and from January - March 2023, I had lost so much weight that I was just skin and bones. Thankfully, during my second hospitalization at the end of March 2023, I received an infusion of Remicade. This medicine worked miraculously on me. Within hours I felt like a dark cloud that had been keeping me down, had just floated away. I was able to recover in just a couple of months. By July 2023, my colon looked almost normal. During my recovery, I also implemented a healthy gut routine. The tables below show my healthy gut routine, which has kept me free from any flares since my first infusion of Remicade. This information might be helpful to someone else who is suffering from Ulcerative Colitis, or anyone who is interested in improving his or her gut health.
    </p>

        UPDATE FEB 2024: My fecal calprotectin level returned to a high level. I strayed from my normal routine during the Christmas and New Years Holidays, and some inflammation returned. Thankfully, my infusion of Inflectra once again 'put out the fire'. And I learned a valuable lesson: I MUST minimize stress, especially during the holidays.
