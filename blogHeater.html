	<h3>Zodi Hot Vent Tent Heater: SAFE and DRY heat for a Minivan.</h3>

	<p> I use a Zodi Hot Vent Tent Heater to heat my minivan. This heater is attached to a TailGator Tire Table using various clamps and supports. The heater is very stable, and it won't fall over, even if it's windy. I cut two holes in the side of my minivan. One hole is for a hose to bring in the warmed air. The other hole allows me to reach the heater from inside my minivan. This way I can reach through the hole, and light the burner or adjust the knob to control the flame while I'm inside my minivan. I haven't completely tested out this heater, but so far it works nicely.</p>

	<p> The Zodi Hot Vent Tent Heater requires a source of propane and a 12 volt dc battery to run a fan. The fan uses 20 watts of power at full speed. Inside the "hot vent", there are copper tubes that are heated by a propane burner. The fan sucks in cold air. This cold air is heated when it passes through the hot copper tubes. Finally, the warmed air enters the minivan. </p>

	<p> There are several advantages to this setup:
        <ol>
            <li>The combustion is outside of the vehicle, so there is no risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.</li>
            <li>The risk of fire is substantially reduced since the burner is outside of the vehicle.</li>
            <li>If propane somehow leaked from the propane bottle, the propane would simply fall to the ground and disperse, since propane is heavier than air.</li>
            <li>The warmed air that enters the minivan is DRY, since this air is heated indirectly by passing through hot copper tubes. The byproducts of combustion are carbon dioxide and water, so you don't want to directly heat a small space with propane. The water vapor would add moisture to the inside of your vehicle.</li>
            <li>The heater works well at high altitudes.</li>
            <li>I can point the output hose to exactly where I want the heat to go.</li>
            <li>You can barely hear the fan that sucks in cold air, since this fan is located outside of the vehicle. Also, since this heater doesn't require a fuel pump, there are no clicking noises from a fuel pump.</li>
            <li>I think that it's unlikely that the heater will break.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

	<p> There are some disadvantages to this setup:
        <ol>
            <li>It takes 5-10 minutes to set up the heater, and it takes 5-10 minutes to take down the heater.</li>
            <li>While the heater is stored, most of the components fit in a 13 inch cubic sized milk crate. This is fairly compact, but anything that takes up the limited storage space in a minivan is a disadvantage.</li>
            <li>The setup is not 'stealthy'.</li>
            <li>If you want the heater to run longer than 3 hrs, then you will need a larger propane tank, or multiple 1 lb bottles. I use 1 lb Flame King refillable propane bottles. It's a bad idea to drive with a large propane tank in a minivan. So if you want to carry a large propane tank, then you should store it in a cargo box outside of your vehicle.</li>
        </ol>

	<p> For the way that I car camp and travel, the Zodi Hot Vent Tent Heater is the best heater for me. </p>
