	<h3>Pormido 998s rear view mirror dash cam. It's fantastic!</h3>

	<p> I highly recommend the Pormido 998s rear view mirror dash cam. Rear view mirror cameras have several advantages over a standard rear view mirror:
        <ol>
            <li>In case of an accident, the camera provides video evidence of what happened.</li>
            <li>The rear view mirror provides a wider viewing angle so you barely have any blind spots.</li>
            <li>If you plan to make a camper van build that blocks your back window, then you can still "see" out of the back since the camera provides the views!</li>
            <li>With the Pormido 998s,the view at NIGHT is even better than a standard rear view mirror. However, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OTHER BRANDS! Headlights from other cars wash out the entire image in the rear view mirror if you use other brands. Other brands are too dangerous to use, so only buy the Pormido brand.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

	<p> I suggest that you also buy a kit that allows you to power the rear view mirror camera directly from the vehicle fuse box. Then you don't need to use a bulky 12V socket adapter. </p>
