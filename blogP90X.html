	<p> I bought the P90X workout program in 2009. Back then, P90X was a revolutionary home workout program because it was so intense, and because Tony Horton, the creator of P90X, was such a great motivator. I loved these routines, and I still follow them today - 15 years later! (As a warning though: I have never performed more than three or four P90X workouts per week to avoid overtraining.) Over time, my exercise library grew, as I became curious about other home exercise programs. My favorite routines from my exercise library, and additional tips to stay fit are shown below:
